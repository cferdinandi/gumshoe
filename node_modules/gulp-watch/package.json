If `gulp.watch` is working for you, stick with it; otherwise, you can try this `gulp-watch` plugin.\n\nThe main reason for `gulp-watch`'s existence is that it can easily achieve per-file rebuilding on file change:\n\n![Awesome demonstration](https://github.com/floatdrop/gulp-watch/raw/master/img/2014-01-09.gif)\n\n## Installation\n\nRun `npm install gulp-watch`.\n\n## Usage\n\n```js\nvar gulp = require('gulp'),\n    watch = require('gulp-watch');\n\ngulp.task('default', function () {\n    gulp.src('css/**/*.css')\n        .pipe(watch('css/**/*.css', function(files) {\n            return files.pipe(gulp.dest('./one/'));\n        }))\n        .pipe(gulp.dest('./two/'));\n    // `one` and `two` will contain same files\n});\n```\n\n> __Protip:__ until gulpjs 4.0 is released, you can use [gulp-plumber](https://github.com/floatdrop/gulp-plumber) to prevent stops on errors.\n\nMore examples can be found in [`docs/readme.md`](/docs/readme.md).\n\n## API\n\n### watch(glob, [options, callback])\n\nCreates watcher that will spy on files that were matched by `glob` which can be a\n[`node-glob`](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob) string or array of strings.\n\nReturns pass through stream, that will emit vinyl files\n(with additional `event` property) that corresponds to event on file-system.\n\n#### Callback `function(events, done)`\n\nThis function is called, when some group of events (that grouped with\n[`gulp-batch`](https://github.com/floatdrop/gulp-batch)) is happens on file-system.\nAll incoming files that piped in will be grouped and passed to `events` stream as is.\n\n * `events` — is `Stream` of incoming events. Events will be grouped by timeout to prevent multiple tasks to be executed repeatedly by commands like `git pull`.\n * `done` — is callback for your function signal to batch once you are done. This allows you to run your callback as soon as the previous `end`. `done` can be omitter iff callback returning `Stream` or `Promise`, otherwise __it will block__ next events.\n\n#### Options\n\nThis object is passed to [`gaze` options](https://github.com/shama/gaze#properties) directly (refer to [`gaze` documentation](https://github.com/shama/gaze)). For __batched__ mode, we are using [`gulp-batch`](https://github.com/floatdrop/gulp-batch#api), so options from there are also available. And of course options for [`gulp.src`](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp#gulpsrcglobs-options) are used too. If you do not want content from `watch`, then add `read: false` to the `options` object.\n\n#### options.base\nType: `String`  \nDefault: `undefined`\n\nUse explicit base path for files from `glob`.\n\n#### options.name\nType: `String`  \nDefault: `undefined`\n\nName of the watcher. If it present in options, you will get more readable output:\n\n![Naming watchers](https://github.com/floatdrop/gulp-watch/raw/master/img/naming.png)\n\n#### options.verbose\nType: `Boolean` / `undefined`  \nDefault: `undefined`\n\nThis options will enable more verbose output (on `true`) or disable it completly (on `false`).\n\n### Methods\n\nReturned `Stream` from constructor have some useful methods:\n\n * `close()` — calling `gaze.close` and emitting `end`, after `gaze.close` is done.\n\nAlso it has `_gaze` property to access Gaze instance.\n\n### Events\n\n * `end` — all files are stop being watched.\n * `ready` — just re-emitted event from `gaze`.\n * `error` — when something happened inside callback, you will get notified.\n\n### Migration to 1.0.0\n\n * __watch is not emmiting files at start__ - read «[Starting tasks on events](/docs/readme.md#starting-tasks-on-events)» and «[Incremental build](https://github.com/floatdrop/gulp-watch/tree/master/docs#incremental-build)» for workarounds.\n * __watch is now pass through stream__ - which means that streaming files into watch will not add them to gaze. It is very hard to maintain, because watch is not aware about `glob`, from which this files come from and can not re-create vinyl object properly without maintaining cache of the `base` properties of incoming files (yuck).\n * __array of tasks is not accepted as callback__ - this was not working anyway, but rationale behind it - requiring gulp and calling internal method start is bad. This feature will become more clear, when gulp 4.0.0 will be released with new task system. Read «[Starting tasks on events](/docs/readme.md#starting-tasks-on-events)» for right way to do it.\n\n# License\n\nMIT (c) 2014 Vsevolod Strukchinsky (floatdrop@gmail.com)\n\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.org/package/gulp-watch\n[npm-image]: http://img.shields.io/npm/v/gulp-watch.svg?style=flat\n\n[travis-url]: https://travis-ci.org/floatdrop/gulp-watch\n[travis-image]: http://img.shields.io/travis/floatdrop/gulp-watch.svg?style=flat\n\n[coveralls-url]: https://coveralls.io/r/floatdrop/gulp-watch\n[coveralls-image]: http://img.shields.io/coveralls/floatdrop/gulp-watch.svg?style=flat\n\n[depstat-url]: https://david-dm.org/floatdrop/gulp-watch\n[depstat-image]: http://img.shields.io/david/floatdrop/gulp-watch.svg?style=flat\n",
